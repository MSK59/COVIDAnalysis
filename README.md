# COVIDAnalysis
COVID-19 devastated the world from its first introduction in 2019. Most nations weren't prepared to contain such a contagious disease. The purpose of this study is to analyze COVID's effects in its first year. We'll look at how COVID globally took the world by storm and how it differed across nations. We'll use time-series analysis to identify key trends and correlations. The study will then focus on the United States and use the euclidean distance on control variables, such as median age and GDP per capita to identify countries most similar to the United States. With this data, we'll perform time-series analysis over phases to determine how well each country did comparatively to deal with COVID and use this data to make offer policy suggestions for the US in case of future incidents.
